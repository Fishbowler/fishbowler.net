i18n is hard, you need all the content in all languages

Maybe a fake language of Zzzz's to look for missing strings

But once that's done, there are dragons

What about Error Messages, especially ones returned from APIs?

User Preferences - I'm in the UK and I'm trying to learn French, or French is my first language - is that okay? Location vs Locale

If no, just language by location, yeah? What about Canada or Tunisia? Multi-lingual countries? Do you pick a primary?

All content in all languages in all countries - that's a lot of work, and expensive for professional translation.

Like some of datetime stuff, it's not just fact - it's a business decision.
