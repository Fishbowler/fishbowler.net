Had a great chat in an interview.

Automating actions, not just E2E
Automated reporting over logging, over synthetics.
Standard deviations against metrics.
E2E web in Cypress or Playwright (don't forget console errors)
E2E mobile in Appium or Maestro (don't forget deeplinks, what about emails?)
Visual regression tests
API tests
Automating generating API clients from Swagger to use in automation
i18n testing - tools assisted?
Unit Tests
Performance - JMeter and similar for API requests, E2E measuring page loads, counting the time of Unit Tests
