I spent time last year focussing on teaching skills. I knew that I taught people, at work and in the testing community, but was also acutely aware that there's an entire industry of trained pedagogues out there, with actual proper skills that I didn't have, and I could certainly learn to improve. There's probably another post in what I learned, but lately I'm trying to focus on being more aware of my learning.

I've always been aware that I'm a learner. I like non-fiction, I like museums, I like holidays that have interesting day trips to see something. But that's so unstructured, and largely for fun. I probably shouldn't approach my professional learning that way. I needed to be better. I wanted to learn the things that I _wanted_ to learn, not just whatever links popped up in Slack that day. I wanted to learn the things that my company needed me to good at _next_, not just learning as I went in order to survive the day.

As part of learning about teaching last year, I was recording what everyone was teaching each other in the weekly sessions we'd set up for sharing. Looking back over that I realised that for the large part, I also had a pretty good record of what I was learning within that space.

I started by extending this, and being more cognisant of what I was learning (see my [3 things](/tags/3things/) posts, for example). Once I knew what I was learning, I was better able to look at the gaps, and know the things that I wouldn't learn accidentally or incidentally. I was able to think about the things I wanted to know more about, and have conversations with my boss and my colleagues about the things that might be useful to know in the future.

The next step was to plan my learning. I don't mean a lesson plan or anything so formal. What I wanted to do was:

* to capture the stuff I would learn, to set myself high-level goals and make myself accountable to them
* have ways capture as I went the things that I encountered that I might like to learn
