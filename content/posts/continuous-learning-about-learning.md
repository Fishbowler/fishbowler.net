I spent time last year focussing on teaching skills. I knew that I taught people, at work and in the testing community, but was also acutely aware that there's an entire industry of trained pedagogues out there, with actual proper skills that I didn't have, and I could certainly learn to improve. There's probably another post in what I learned, but lately I'm trying to focus on being more aware of my learning.

I've always been aware that I'm a learner. I like non-fiction, I like museums, I like holidays that have interesting day trips to see something. But that's so unstructured, and largely for fun. I probably shouldn't approach my professional learning that way. I started by being cognisant of what I was learning (see my [3 things](/tags/3things/) posts, for example).
