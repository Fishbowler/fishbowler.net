I'm a tester, living in Nottingham, originally from Bristol (and sound like it too).

I believe in 
* context driven testing
* in creating test artefacts that have value (to the team or to the business)
* that two testers can approach a testing problem with different methods and achieve equally good results
* not constraining learning to specific outcomes
* learning, always, for fun or for profit.

I put things on GitHub in case people find them useful, but mostly because it's the safest place not to lose them. My blog is the same - I write to clarify my thinking, and as a surrogate memory. If other people get some value from it, that's awesome.
